An easy-to-use plugin to add a PayPal button to your site. Uses custom fields to store the data.

== Description ==

This plugin uses custom fields to make creating a PayPal button super-easy. There is no complicated shortcut syntax to remember and you can select on which type of post (including custom post types) you'd like to display the button. You can enter default settings which can then be changed for individual posts where necessary - might come in for sites with multiple users.

The button is customizable - choose between 2 themes (dark and light) with custom text, or simply display a standard large or small PayPal button (either 'Buy Now' or 'Donate')

Your PayPal username is encrypted so it can't (easily) be harvested for spam by the evil spam robots of Mordor.

This plugin is created for WordPress 3.x and currently only supports 'Buy Now' and 'Donation' functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the Easy PayPal Custom Fields folder to the plugins directory in your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin
3. Navigate to the Easy PayPal Custom Fields settings to enter you default settings (these can then be customized for each post).
